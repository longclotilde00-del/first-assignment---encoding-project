# First assignment - Readme file

The materials I chose are three letters written by François Truffaut, a french director from the New Wave, adressed to Jean Gruault, his friend and a french screenwriter and producer. These letters are part of the Fonds Jean Gruault well preserved in the Francois Truffaut library in Paris. The three letters intertwined professional discussions and amical notes on cinema, thus reflecting their complex relationship as colleagues and friends, enthusiasts and professionals. 

I selected these three letters because they give us an intimate glimpse into the lives of two well-known french cinema figures from the 1950s and because they witness the bonds forged around making movies. Furthermore, these letters are interesting because they are annotated in François Truffaut's own handwriting, combining typewritten text with later handwritten notes, which give us an insight into the director's train of thought as he wrote. 

This point precisely explains why XML can help structure and enrich my project, since the use of XML can clarify this intermingling of handwritten notes and typewritten text, thereby clarifying the structure of the letter while making it explicit with the help of metadata. Thus, XML allows us to give structure to all three letters by organizing the handwritten notes and clarifying their connection to the rest of the content. XML can help make understandable and clear the complex nature of these letters. 

I used ChatGPT for this assignment to help me understand the errors detected by Oxygen in my XML and DTD files.
